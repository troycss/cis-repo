    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p1>Hello, my name is Troy.  In a world where so much
        of our information is available online,
        I find that I want to be a little more reserved.
        This is my first attempt at a website for the purpose of sharing
        a little bit about myself.
    </p1>
    <p2>
        I had a pretty amazing career in film for 
        the first portion of my adult life.  It seems
        that it has come to an end though.  What I really enjoyed 
        was that the job could be as difficult as your team
        made it.  Because having a good attitude made even
        the most difficult days much more fun.
    </p2>

    <p3>
        I am now finding myself casting a wide net.
        It's not that I don't know what I want to do with 
        my life, but rather that the world and technology
        is changing so fast, that I just want to make sure I can do something
        to provide for my family.
    </p3>

    <p4>
        I'll keep updating this and mending the previous sections as I go,
        but for now I think this will do.
    </p4>
