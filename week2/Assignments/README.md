Assignment 2
    Personal Portfolio Project

    I started this project last week when we went over flex boxes.  A colleague of mine had told me about bootstrap and I've always wanted to figure out how to use it. This is my attempt.  It's neat that even a very basic understanding has created a reactive  website.  I don't know if the requirements for this website were originally on the slides, so I started trying to make a light/dark/high contrast toggle to create more accessibility. As of right now, the toggle is just a checkbox in the upper right corner as I attempt to complete the requirements.

Semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, section, footer)
