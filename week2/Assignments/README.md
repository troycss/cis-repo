Assignment 2
    Personal Portfolio Project

    I started this project last week when we went over flex boxes.  A colleague of mine had told me about bootstrap and I've always wanted to figure out how to use it. This is my attempt.  It's neat that even a very basic understanding has created a reactive  website.  I don't know if the requirements for this website were originally on the slides, so I started trying to make a light/dark/high contrast toggle to create more accessibility. As of right now, the toggle is just a checkbox in the upper right corner as I attempt to complete the requirements.

    HTML Requirements:
Semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, section, footer)
At least one navigation menu
Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
Images with alt text
At least one form element (contact form optional)


CSS Requirements:
External stylesheet properly linked
CSS variables for consistent theming
Flexbox or Grid for layout
Both Flexbox and Grid should be used somewhere
Custom font (Google Fonts or similar)

Projects/Work: At least 3 project cards
Footer:

10%: Creativity. 1% was barely attempted. 10% whoa you had fun with this.
